In this stage, you'll send a response with a correlation ID.
Response message

Kafka brokers communicate with clients through the Kafka wire protocol. The protocol uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request message and the broker replies with a response message.

A Kafka response message has three parts:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

For this stage, you can ignore the body and just focus on message_size and the header. You'll learn about response bodies in a later stage.
The message_size field

The message_size field is a 32-bit signed integer. It specifies the size of the header and body.

For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes longâ€”it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
Header

Kafka has a few different header versions. The way Kafka determines which header version to use is a bit complicated and is outside the scope of this challenge. For more information, take a look at KIP-482 and this Stack Overflow answer.

In this stage, you will use response header v0 (scroll down).

Response header v0 contains a single field: correlation_id. This field lets clients match responses to their original requests. Here's how it works:

    The client generates a correlation ID.
    The client sends a request that includes the correlation ID.
    The broker sends a response that includes the same correlation ID.
    The client receives the response and matches the correlation ID to the original request.

The correlation_id field is a 32-bit signed integer. For this stage, your program must respond with a hard-coded correlation_id of 7.
Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request:

$ echo -n "Placeholder request" | nc -v localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

Your broker must send a response with a correlation ID of 7:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
00 00 00 07  // correlation_id: 7

Notes

    For this stage, you don't need to parse the request. You'll learn about request parsing in a later stage.
    All integers are in big-endian order.
