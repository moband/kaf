## Send Correlation ID: 

In this stage, you'll send a response with a correlation ID.
Response message

Kafka brokers communicate with clients through the Kafka wire protocol. The protocol uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request message and the broker replies with a response message.

A Kafka response message has three parts:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

For this stage, you can ignore the body and just focus on message_size and the header. You'll learn about response bodies in a later stage.
The message_size field

The message_size field is a 32-bit signed integer. It specifies the size of the header and body.

For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
Header

Kafka has a few different header versions. The way Kafka determines which header version to use is a bit complicated and is outside the scope of this challenge. For more information, take a look at KIP-482 and this Stack Overflow answer.

In this stage, you will use response header v0 (scroll down).

Response header v0 contains a single field: correlation_id. This field lets clients match responses to their original requests. Here's how it works:

    The client generates a correlation ID.
    The client sends a request that includes the correlation ID.
    The broker sends a response that includes the same correlation ID.
    The client receives the response and matches the correlation ID to the original request.

The correlation_id field is a 32-bit signed integer. For this stage, your program must respond with a hard-coded correlation_id of 7.
Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request:

$ echo -n "Placeholder request" | nc -v localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

Your broker must send a response with a correlation ID of 7:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
00 00 00 07  // correlation_id: 7

Notes

    For this stage, you don't need to parse the request. You'll learn about request parsing in a later stage.
    All integers are in big-endian order.

# Parse Correlation ID

In this stage, you'll replace the hard-coded correlation ID with the actual correlation ID from the request.
Request message

A request message has three parts:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

To get the correlation_id field, you need to find its offset. You already know that message_size is 4 bytes long. And here's what the request header looks like (in this stage, we're using request header v2):
Field 	Data type 	Description
request_api_key 	INT16 	The API key for the request
request_api_version 	INT16 	The version of the API for the request
correlation_id 	INT32 	A unique identifier for the request
client_id 	NULLABLE_STRING 	The client ID for the request
TAG_BUFFER 	COMPACT_ARRAY 	Optional tagged fields

To learn more about the different data types, see Protocol Primitive Types.
Example

Here's an example of a request message:

00 00 00 23  // message_size:        35
00 12        // request_api_key:     18
00 04        // request_api_version: 4
6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id:      1870644833
...

Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request with a request header v2:

$ echo -n "00000023001200046f7fc66100096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

Your broker must send a response with the correct correlation ID:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id: 1870644833

Notes

    For this stage, you don't need to worry about what the request is asking for. You'll handle that in the next stage.
    For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
    The request header version and response header version are unrelated to each other and do not have to match.

# Parse API Version



In this stage, you'll parse the request_api_version field in the request header and respond with an error code if the version is invalid.
Kafka APIs

Every Kafka request is an API call. The Kafka protocol defines over 70 different APIs, all of which do different things. Here are some examples:

    Produce writes events to partitions.
    CreateTopics creates new topics.
    ApiVersions returns the broker's supported API versions.

A Kafka request specifies the API its calling by using the request_api_key header field.
Message body

The schemas for the request and response bodies are determined by the API being called.

For example, here are some of the fields that the Produce request body contains:

    The name of the topic to write to.
    The key of the partition to write to.
    The event data to write.

On the other hand, the Produce response body contains a response code for each event. These response codes indicate if the writes succeeded.

As a reminder, requests and responses both have the following format:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

API versioning

Each API supports multiple versions, to allow for different schemas. Here's how API versioning works:

    Requests use the header field request_api_version to specify the API version being requested.
    Responses always use the same API version as the request. For example, a Produce Request (Version: 3) will always get a Produce Response (Version: 3) back.
    Each API's version history is independent. So, different APIs with the same version are unrelated. For example, Produce Request (Version: 10) is not related to Fetch Request (Version: 10).

The ApiVersions API

The ApiVersions API returns the broker's supported API versions. For example, ApiVersions may say that the broker supports Produce versions 5 to 11, Fetch versions 0 to 3, etc.

In this stage, you'll begin to add support for ApiVersions version 4. For this stage, you only need to add support for the error_code field. You'll implement the other fields in later stages.

Note: As of Oct 30th 2024, version 4 of ApiVersions is still unreleased, so it isn't available in the Kafka docs yet. However, the request and response formats for ApiVersions version 4 are identical to those of version 3. The docs for version 4 will be available once Kafka 3.9 is released.

The ApiVersions response body begins with error_code, a 16-bit signed integer. This field indicates if an error occurred with the request. It's set to 0 if there was no error. To see all the possible values, consult the error codes chart.

You only need to add support for error code 35, UNSUPPORTED_VERSION. This error code occurs when the version of ApiVersions requested by the client is not supported by the broker. Assume that your broker only supports versions 0 to 4.
Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh  

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send an ApiVersions request. This request will ask for an unsupported version of ApiVersions:

$ echo -n "000000230012674a4f74d28b00096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

00 00 00 23  // message_size:        35
00 12        // request_api_key:     18
67 4a        // request_api_version: 26442
4f 74 d2 8b  // correlation_id:      1333056139
...

Your broker must send an ApiVersions version 4 response with the error_code field set to 35:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
4f 74 d2 8b  // correlation_id: 1333056139
00 23        // error_code:     35

Notes

    The Kafka protocol's APIs are different from Kafka's core APIs. The core APIs are higher-level Java and Scala APIs that wrap around the Kafka protocol.
    You can assume that the tester will only send you an ApiVersions request. You don't need to check the request_api_key field in the header.
    For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
