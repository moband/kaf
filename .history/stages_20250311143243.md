## Send Correlation ID: 

In this stage, you'll send a response with a correlation ID.
Response message

Kafka brokers communicate with clients through the Kafka wire protocol. The protocol uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request message and the broker replies with a response message.

A Kafka response message has three parts:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

For this stage, you can ignore the body and just focus on message_size and the header. You'll learn about response bodies in a later stage.
The message_size field

The message_size field is a 32-bit signed integer. It specifies the size of the header and body.

For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
Header

Kafka has a few different header versions. The way Kafka determines which header version to use is a bit complicated and is outside the scope of this challenge. For more information, take a look at KIP-482 and this Stack Overflow answer.

In this stage, you will use response header v0 (scroll down).

Response header v0 contains a single field: correlation_id. This field lets clients match responses to their original requests. Here's how it works:

    The client generates a correlation ID.
    The client sends a request that includes the correlation ID.
    The broker sends a response that includes the same correlation ID.
    The client receives the response and matches the correlation ID to the original request.

The correlation_id field is a 32-bit signed integer. For this stage, your program must respond with a hard-coded correlation_id of 7.
Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request:

$ echo -n "Placeholder request" | nc -v localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

Your broker must send a response with a correlation ID of 7:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
00 00 00 07  // correlation_id: 7

Notes

    For this stage, you don't need to parse the request. You'll learn about request parsing in a later stage.
    All integers are in big-endian order.

# Parse Correlation ID

In this stage, you'll replace the hard-coded correlation ID with the actual correlation ID from the request.
Request message

A request message has three parts:

    message_size
    Header
    Body

To get the correlation_id field, you need to find its offset. You already know that message_size is 4 bytes long. And here's what the request header looks like (in this stage, we're using request header v2):
Field 	Data type 	Description
request_api_key 	INT16 	The API key for the request
request_api_version 	INT16 	The version of the API for the request
correlation_id 	INT32 	A unique identifier for the request
client_id 	NULLABLE_STRING 	The client ID for the request
TAG_BUFFER 	COMPACT_ARRAY 	Optional tagged fields

To learn more about the different data types, see Protocol Primitive Types.
Example

Here's an example of a request message:

00 00 00 23  // message_size:        35
00 12        // request_api_key:     18
00 04        // request_api_version: 4
6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id:      1870644833
...

Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request with a request header v2:

$ echo -n "00000023001200046f7fc66100096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C

Your broker must send a response with the correct correlation ID:

00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id: 1870644833

Notes

    For this stage, you don't need to worry about what the request is asking for. You'll handle that in the next stage.
    For this stage, the tester will only assert that your message_size field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct message_size values in a later stage.
    The request header version and response header version are unrelated to each other and do not have to match.
